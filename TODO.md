# MUST DO

**folders with small amounts of samples should be augmented**

**first do nocall identification (freefield1010) on the data**

**check for duplicate audio files and discard them**

**peak-normalize each 5s segment to 0.25 (by google bird bovalization classifier)**

**Postprocess: To predict chunk n, the models take 10 seconds: 5 seconds from the chunk n and 2.5 seconds from the previous and next chunks. (top solution)**

**Cross entropy loss**
